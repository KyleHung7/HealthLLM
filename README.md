## Project Introduction
The AI Care Analysis Website aims to help caregivers manage care records more easily and provide health analysis through AI technology.

### **Problems Addressed**
1. **Elderly individuals lack awareness of their own health conditions**, making it difficult to communicate issues effectively.
2. **Manual record-keeping for caregivers is tedious**, lacking systematic analysis.
3. **Absence of long-term data analysis**, preventing timely health risk predictions.

### **Solutions**
- **AI-assisted Q&A** helps caregivers record health information.
- **Automated care reports** reduce manual data entry burdens.
- **Health trend analysis** aids caregivers in identifying abnormalities in advance.
- **Intelligent Q&A** provides personalized care recommendations.

## Workflow
![AI prompts questions (e g , “How was the elder’s appetite today”) Caregiver inputs answers AI processes and records](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/682b4e83-586f-4a9e-8642-fed37e1f9849)

## Technical Architecture & Development Timeline

### **Technical Architecture**
- **Backend**: Python + Flask for data processing and AI analysis.
- **Frontend**: Web interface for an intuitive user experience.
- **Data Processing**: Machine learning for health trend analysis.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Integrating long-term care guidelines for personalized recommendations.

### **Development Timeline**
- **Weeks 9 - 15**: System development and testing.
- **Week 16**: Presentation and demonstration of results.

## Long-Term Goals & Development Direction
We aim to develop this system towards a **software-driven model in Taiwan**, leveraging **Web and AI to improve care efficiency** rather than relying solely on hardware solutions.

### **Challenges in Taiwan’s Long-Term Care Industry**
- Shortage of workforce, high turnover rates, and heavy caregiving workload.

### **Our Solutions**
✅ **Software Automation**: Simplifies caregiving workflows.

✅ **Data-Driven Decision Making**: AI assists in health analysis and risk prediction.

✅ **Personalized AI Interaction**: Provides real-time and precise care recommendations.

This is not just about reducing manpower burden but also about enhancing the overall efficiency and quality of the long-term care industry.
