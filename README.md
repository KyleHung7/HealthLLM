## 🧠 Project Overview

**HealthLLM: AI-Powered Blood Pressure & Glucose Analysis for Elders**

This project addresses the rising health risks of **hypertension and diabetes** among the elderly in Taiwan—two of the top ten causes of death.  
It offers a **digital solution for families and caregivers** to monitor and manage elderly health data in real time using AI analysis.

---

## 🚨 Real-World Problem

- In Taiwan, **11,625 people died from diabetes** and **8,930 from hypertension** in 2023.
- **20–60% of diabetics** also suffer from hypertension, increasing risks of chronic complications like kidney failure or blindness.
- A case of an elderly patient fainting due to **hypoglycemia** after improper diet and medication adjustment highlighted the need for better daily monitoring.
- **Manual record-keeping is scattered**, often split between paper logs and chat apps like LINE, making data hard to manage.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Enable families to **track elder health daily and accurately**
- Reduce health risks due to **lack of medical knowledge**
- Simplify health **recording and reporting** for caregivers
- Enhance **trust and peace of mind** through intelligent alerts

---

## 👥 Target Users

- **Elderly Patients (50+)** with hypertension or diabetes  
- **Family Caregivers (30–50 yrs)** actively involved in daily monitoring  
- **Care Institutions & Home Caregivers** managing multiple elders' data  

---

## 💡 Solution: HealthLLM System

We built a web-based platform tailored for senior healthcare that integrates:

- 📸 **Elder uploads photos** of health data → caregiver notified instantly  
- 📝 **Caregiver view**: table-based health logs, trend charts, and auto-generated reports  
- 🤖 **AI Assistant** for real-time Q&A and care guidance  
- 📤 **PDF reports** ready for doctor visits or family sharing  

---

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Intuitive web interface (React + Tailwind)  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) for data handling & AI processing  
- **AI Tools**:
  - Trend detection (blood pressure & glucose)
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for customized care advice  
- **Google OAuth**: Secure login for elders and caregivers
